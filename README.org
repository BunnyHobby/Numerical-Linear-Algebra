* Solving a Linear System 

       1.2x + 3.4y + 5.6z = 36.4

       7.8x + 9.0y + 1.2z = 87.6

       3.4x + 5.6y + 7.8z = 62.8

       We wonder the values of /x/, /y/, and /z/.

* Building and Running the Code

       Create a plain text file call *Makefile* in your *quiz2* /directory/.
       
       Type =make= in the *Terminal* and to run it, type =./quiz2=.
